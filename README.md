# Guilty Gear Strive + Gatlings
## [Releases On GameBanana](https://gamebanana.com/members/submissions/sublog/1952193)

Strive + Gatlings is a mod which aims to 
add gatlings from the old Guilty Gear games back 
into Guilty Gear Strive. This mod will hopefully change 
the way the game feels in a way that players old and new
might find more enjoyable.

This mod aims to be a mostly-unopinionated addition,
adding only gatlings and small game tweaks
without heavily changing other mechanics.
However there will be a version available that adds small balance updates and tweaks to the mechanics.

# FAQ
- Do these mods work online?
Yes! These script mods will work online as long as both players have them installed.

- Can I still play players using an unmodded game?
Unfortunately no, it will desync. You need to uninstall the mods in order to play players using an unmodded game.
